# For Twitch API 
check notebook ST445_GAMING.ipynb

# For Data collection and write data into BigQuery table
check notebook twitch_chat_liste.ipynb
## to do with this
**1. game list**
Now the game list is selected mannully from website https://www.twitch.tv/directory/gaming, used the recommended game names, and some in my head.
Should data scrapping considered here? - I don't think twitch or the api request can allow that much, but can give it a try.

**2. channel list**
Now the channel list is selected from lives with the 20 most audiences at real-time in each game. This should be fine as frequent group actions are something we mainly want to study.
